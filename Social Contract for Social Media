Preamble: Given the recent concerns about social media through scientific studies and personal accounts from people who worked
in the industry, this social contract aims to select the policies for social media use through a peer-modified forum. 
Disclaimer: The goal is not as simply as deleting an app. We want to be able to navigate through this new technology.

1) Turn off social media push-notifications on your smart phone. Enter applications using your own initiative.
2) Collect all social media apps into one folder and place it on a page other than your home page. 
3) Do not keep social media pages open on your computer, espically during work. 
4) The age requirement should be 16. 
5) Make a written list of pages that you follow.
